% A) Description: 
% 
% The case study was inspired by a system architecture definition study for
% a distributed in-car radio navigation system. Such a system typically
% executes a number of independant but nevertheless concurrent applications
% that share a common platform. Each application has its own individual
% timeliness requirements that need to be satisfied. In this case study,
% three applications are specified using annotated UML sequence diagrams;
% ChangeVolume (A), AddressLookup (B) and HandleTMC (C). You are asked to
% evaluate the combinations A-C and B-C on five alternative distributed
% architectures. Informal definitions are provided for the deployment of
% these applications on those potential architectures. Hence, the case
% study should be seen as an exercise to perform simple design space
% exploration of a (soft) real-time system. The questions to answer are:
% - How do the proposed system architecture
%   compare in respect to system level end-to-end delays?
%   Are the WCRT requirements satisfied or not?
% - How robust is architecture A?
%   Where is the bottleneck of this architecture?
% - Architecture D is chosen for further investigation.
%   How should the processors be dimensioned while still
%   meeting the WCRT requirements

% Note: in the following analysis, the end-to-end delays are computed as
% addition of the individual delays. Normally, one would compute the end-to
% -end delays through service curve convolutions. For the analyzed system
% configuration, the analysis results are equal for both methods. Since
% analysis through addition is considerably faster, this method was chosen.
