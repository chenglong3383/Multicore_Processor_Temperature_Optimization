function [p, j, d, s] = rtcconvpjd(c, varargin)
% RTCCONVPJD determines period, jitter and minimal delay of a set of curves
%   c - set of curves to be approximated
%   p - period of curves (may be provided as an optional second argument)
%   j - jitter of curves
%   d - minimal interarrival distance between two events
%   s - stepsize for a single event (1, if no optional second argument)
%
%   If no second argument is provided, the period is determined
%   automatically using the slope of c and assuming a stepsize of 1.
%   Otherwise, the second argument is the period and the stepsize is
%   determined.
%
%   Preconditions: slopes of upper and lower curves should be equal;
%   1/slope of input curves needs to be an integer if no period is provided;
%   the provided period needs to be a positive integer;
