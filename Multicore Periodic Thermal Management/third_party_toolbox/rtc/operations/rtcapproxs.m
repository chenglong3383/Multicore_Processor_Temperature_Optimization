% RTCAPPROXS approximates a given SINGLE curve
%   c - curve to be approximated
%   px0New - end of the aperiodic part
%   pdxNew - new period for the periodic part (if 0, then only aperiodic)
%   isUpper - 1 if upper curve; 0 if lower curve
% 
%   pdxNew needs to be an integer, pdxNew < Inf. 
%   px0New needs to be < Inf if c has a periodic part, px0New >= 0.
