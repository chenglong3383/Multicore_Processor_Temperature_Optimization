function result = rtcapprox(c, px0New, pdxNew)
% RTCAPPROX approximates a given set of curves
%   c - set of curves to be approximated
%   px0New - end of the aperiodic part
%   pdxNew - new period for the periodic part (if 0, then only aperiodic)
% 
%   pdxNew needs to be an integer, pdxNew < Inf. 
%   px0New needs to be < Inf if c has a periodic part, px0New >= 0.
