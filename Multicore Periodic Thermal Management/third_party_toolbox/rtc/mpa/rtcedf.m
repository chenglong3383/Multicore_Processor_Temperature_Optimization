% RTCEDF   Compute the output of an EDF processing component.
%    [A1',Del1,Buf1,...,An',Deln,Bufn, B']=RTCEDF(A1,E1,D1,...,An,En,Dn, B)
%    computes the output curves of an EDF processing component that
%    processes a set of n discrete event streams with arrival curves A1,A2,
%    ...,An on an EDF resource with service curve B. E1,E2, ...,En denote
%    the worst case and best case execution demands and D1,D2, ...,Dn
%    denote the deadlines associated to the n input streams.
%
%    The curves are represented as sets Ai = [AUi ALi] where AUi and ALi
%    are the upper and lower arrival curves of event stream i. The output
%    arrival curves Ai' have the same data structure as Ai.
%
%    B = [BU BL] are the upper and lower service curves of the component.
%    The output service curve B' has the same data structure as B.
%
%    Ei = [WCEDi BCEDi] are the worst case and best case execution demands
%    of events in stream i. The execution demand can be a scalar: In this
%    case we have WCEDi = BCEDi (worst case execution demand = best case
%    execution demand). Di are the deadlines associated to events in stream
%    i.
%
%    Deli denote the maximum delays which the events of the streams observe
%    between arrival and output. Bufi denote the maximal buffer space for
%    each stream.
%    
%    The component issues a warning if deadlines are not respected (EDF
%    schedulability test).
%
%    An EDF processing component is triggered by the events of an incoming
%    event stream. A fully preemptable task is instantiated at every event
%    arrival to process the incoming event, and active tasks are processed
%    in a greedy fashion with dynamic priorities according to their
%    deadlines )EDF).
