% RTCDEL   Compute the maximum delay at a GPC.
%    RTCDEL(A,B) computes the maximum delay experienced
%    by an event on a discrete event stream with upper arrival 
%    curve A that is processed by a greedy processing
%    component (RTCGPC) that runs on a resource with 
%    lower service curve B. With these parameters, it is
%    assumed that B is already adapted to the event worst-
%    case execution demand.
%
%    RTCDEL(A,B,WCED) computes the maximum delay experienced
%    by a discrete event with worst-case exeuction demand WCED, 
%    that arrives on an event stream with upper arrival 
%    curve A and that is processed by a greedy processing
%    component (RTCGPC) that runs on a resource with 
%    lower service curve B.
%
%    RTCDEL(A,B1,B2,...,BN) computes the total 
%    end-to-end delay experienced by a event on a discrete event 
%    stream with upper arrival curve A that is processed on
%    N consecutive GPC's with lower serivce curves 
%    B1,...,BN. With these parameters, it is assumed that 
%    the B's are already adapted to the various event worst-
%    case execution demands.
%
%    RTCDEL(A,B1,WCED1,B2,WCED2,...,BN,WCEDN) computes the total 
%    end-to-end delay experienced by an event on a discrete event 
%    stream with upper arrival curve A that is processed on
%    N consecutive GPC's with lower serivce curves 
%    B1,...,BN and with event worst-case execution demands
%    WCED1,...,WCEDN.
%
%    The curves A and Bi can also be replaced by curve sets.
