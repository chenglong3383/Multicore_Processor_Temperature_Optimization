function b = rtcbuf(alpha,varargin)
% RTCBUF   Compute the buffer requirement at a GPC.
%    RTCBUF(A,B) computes the maximum buffer space that
%    is required to buffer a discrete event stream with upper
%    arrival curve A in the input queue of a greedy
%    processing component (RTCGPC) that runs on a resource
%    with lower service curve B. With these parameters, it is
%    assumed that B is already adapted to the event worst-
%    case execution demand.
%
%    RTCBUF(A,B,WCED) computes the maximum buffer space that
%    is required to buffer a discrete event stream with upper
%    arrival curve A and with event worst-case execution
%    demand WCED in the input queue of a greedy
%    processing component (RTCGPC) that runs on a resource
%    with lower service curve B. 
%
%    RTCBUF(A,B1,B2,...,BN) computes the total maximum 
%    buffer space that is required to buffer a discrete event 
%    stream with arrival curve A that is processed on 
%    N consecutive GPC's with lower serivce curves 
%    B1,...,BN, that use shared memory for their 
%    input queues. With these parameters, it is assumed that 
%    the B's are already adapted to the various event worst-
%    case execution demands.
%
%    RTCBUF(A,B1,WCED1,B2,WCED2,...,BN,WCEDN) computes the total 
%    maximum buffer space that is required to buffer a discrete 
%    event stream with arrival curve A that is processed on 
%    N consecutive GPC's with lower serivce curves 
%    B1,...,BN, that use shared memory for their 
%    input queues. The event worst-case execution demands
%    are WCED1,...,WCEDN.
%
%    The curves A and Bi can also be replaced by curve sets.
