%% Part 3: Modular Performance Analysis


%% Introduction
% Modular Performance Analysis (MPA) with Real-Time Calculus is used to 
% analyze the performance of hard real-time systems. In particular, MPA can
% be used for example to analyze end-to-end delays, buffer requirements or
% throughput of such systems.
%
% The central idea of Modular Performance Analysis is, to first build a 
% so-called performance model of the concrete system that bundles all 
% information needed for performance analysis with Real-Time Calculus. The 
% abstract performance model thereby unifies essential information about
% the environment, about the available computation and communication
% resources, about the application tasks and dedicated HW/SW components, as
% well as about the system architecture itself.
% 
% Within the system performance model, environment models describe how a
% system is being used by the environment: how often will events (or
% function calls) arrive and how much data is provided as input to the
% system, and how many events and how much data is generated in return by
% the system and is fed back to the environment. Resource models provide
% information about the properties of the computing and communication
% resources that are available within a system, such as processor speed and
% communication bus bandwidth. And finally, application task models or
% dedicated HW/SW component models provide information about the processing
% semantics that is used to execute the various application tasks or to run
% the dedicated HW/SW components. The system model that is typically
% obtained following the well-known Y-Chart scheme 
% specifies how the different models are put together to build the system
% performance model. The system model thereby captures information about
% the applications and the available hardware architecture of the system,
% and it also defines the mapping of tasks to computation or communication
% resources and specifies the scheduling and arbitration schemes used on
% these resources. After interconnecting all models of a system to the
% system performance model as described above, this performance model
% captures all the information that builds the basis for performance
% analysis. Various performance criteria, such as end-to-end delay
% guarantees or buffer requirements can be computed analytically in the
% performance model. The exact analysis methods may thereby vary for
% different components, but remains deterministic at all times.

%% Curve Sets
% The Modular Performance Analysis framework consistently uses a set of 
% an upper as well a lower curve to model event streams or resources. To
% conveniently work with these curve sets, many functions within the RTC
% Toolbox are designed to also work with 2x1-matrices of curves, where the
% first curve element corresponds to an upper curve, and the second curve
% element corresponds to a lower curve: |c_set = [c_upper; c_lower]|

%% Event-Stream Models
% The |rtcpjd| function can be used to create the arrival curve set that
% corresponds to an event stream with a period |p|, a jitter |j|, and a
% minimum event inter-arrival distance |d|. Note that the functions
% |rtcpjdu| and |rtcpjdl| can be used to create only the upper or the lower
% arrival curve of such an event stream, respectively.
a = rtcpjd(3, 5, 1);
rtcplot(a, 'r', 20);

%% Resource Models
% The |rtcfs| function creates the service curve set that corresponds to a
% resource with bandwidth |B| that is fully available. Note that |rtcfsu|
% and |rtcfsl| can be used to create only the upper or the lower service
% curve of such a resource, respectively.
b = rtcfs(0.3);
rtcplot(b, 'b', 20);

%%
% The |rtcbd| function creates the service curve set that corresponds to a
% bounded delay resource with a maximum delay |d| and a bandwidth |B|. Note 
% that |rtcbdu| and |rtcbdl| can be used to create only the upper or the
% lower service curve of such a resource, respectively. 
b = rtcbd(4, 0.3);
rtcplot(b, 'b', 20);

%%
% The |rtcps| function creates the service curve set that corresponds to a
% periodic resource, where a share of |s| is allocated within every period
% |p|, on a resource with total bandwidth |B|. Note that |rtcpsu| and
% |rtcpsl| can be used to create only the upper or the lower service curve
% of such a resource, respectively.
b = rtcps(2, 5, 1);
rtcplot(b, 'b', 20);

%%
% The |rtctdma| function creates the service curve set that corresponds to
% a TDMA resource, where a slot of length |s| is allocated within every
% TDMA cycle |c|, on a resource with total bandwidth |B|. Note that
% |rtctdmau| and |rtctdmal| can be used to create only the upper or the
% lower service curve of such a resource, respectively.
b = rtctdma(2, 5, 1);
rtcplot(b, 'b', 20);

%% HW/SW Component Models
% The |rtcgpc| function computes the output of a greedy processing component.
% A greedy processing component is commonly used to model a single 
% preemptive task running under a fixed priority scheduling policy. But by
% choosing different service curves one can also represent the
% functionality of various kinds of (periodic) servers and TDMA scheduling
% units.
%
% A task has an execution resource demand |ed|, is triggered by a discrete 
% event stream that is modeled as an arrival curve |a|, and is executed on 
% a resource with a service that is modeled as a service curve |b|. For 
% such a task, the |rtcgpc| function computes the arrival curve of the
% outgoing discrete event stream, as well as the service curve of the
% remaining service.
% In addition, the |rtcgpc| function determines the maximal delay of events
% and the maximal buffer space requirement.

%%
% The |rtcedf| function computes the output arrival curve, remaining
% service, maximal delays and buffer space requirements for an EDF
% component. Here, the tasks corresponding to the events of the input
% streams are computed with dynamic priorities that corresponds to the
% earliest deadlines. Again, tasks are supposed to be preemptive. 
%
% The function takes as input arguments the arrival curves of all |n| input
% streams |a1_in|, ..., |an_in|, the corresponding execution demands |ed1|,
% ..., |edn|, all deadlines |d1|, ..., |dn| associated  to the events in
% the streams and the service curve |b_in|. As results we get the output
% arrival curves, the worst-case event delays, the necessary buffer spaces
% and the remaining service.
%
% As in the case of the greedy processing element, |ed = [wced bced]| 
% denotes the worst case and best case execution demands of events. The
% execution demand can be a scalar: In this case we have wced = bced (worst
% case execution demand = best case execution demand).
%
% The |rtcedf| function issues a warning if the given task set is not
% schedulable under EDF.

% There is also a function that implements the abstract properties of a FIFO
% component. In this case, the inputs are processed in the order of their
% arrival at the component. We can just use the example above and replace
% the |rtcedf| function the |rtcfifo|. Of course, no deadlines are

% The |rtcgsc| function computes the output of a greedy shaper component. A
% greedy shaper component shapes a discrete event stream that is modeled as
% an arrival curve |a| with a shaping curve |sigma|. That is, a greedy 
% shaper delays the events of the input event streams, such that the output
% event stream has |s| as an upper arrival curve, and it delays no event 
% any more than necessary. Again, the result of |rtcgsc| also contains the
% maximal event delay and the buffer requirement.

%% Performance Analysis
% The |rtcdel| function computes the maximum delay that is experienced by
% an event on a discrete event stream with arrival curve |a| that is
% processed by a task with execution resource demand |ed| that is modeled
% as a greedy processing component (GPC) and that runs on a resource with
% service curve |b|. The |rtcdel| function can also compute the maximum
% end-to-end delay that is experienced by an event stream when processed on
% |n| consecutive GPC's. Note that this latter computation sometimes leads
% to long execution times within the RTC Toolbox. Moreover, depending on
% the system, the resulting end-to-end delay is sometimes smaller than the
% sum of the individual delays. In this case, the sum of the individual
% delays provides the tighter bound to the end-to-end delay.
%
% Let us first compute the maximum delays of events from a stream with
% arrival curve |a_in| when passing a chain consisting of two GPCs with
% service |b1_in| and |b2_in|.
%%
% <<CHAIN.jpg>>
%%
a_in = rtcpjd(3, 0, 0);
b1_in = rtctdma(2, 7, 4);
ed1 = 3;
[a1_out b1_out del1 buf1] = rtcgpc(a_in, b1_in, ed1);
b2_in = rtcbd(1, 2);
ed2 = 5;
[a2_out b2_out del2 buf2] = rtcgpc(a1_out, b2_in, ed2);
disp(['del1 = ', num2str(del1), '; del2 = ', num2str(del2)]);
disp(['del1 + del2 = ', num2str(del1+del2)]);
%%
% Now, we use the function |rtcdel| in order to get tighter bounds on the
% end-to-end delay of this chain. 
del_e2e =  rtcdel(a_in, b1_in, ed1, b2_in, ed2);
disp(['del_e2e = ', num2str(del_e2e)]);
%%
% The |rtcbuf| function computes the maximum buffer requirement to buffer a
% discrete event stream with arrival curve |a| that is processed by a task
% with execution resource demand |ed| that is modeled as a greedy 
% processing component (GPC) and that runs on a resource with service curve 
% |b|. The |rtcbuf| function can also compute the maximum buffer space that
% is necessary when an event stream is processed on |n| consecutive GPC's,
% if their input queues all access the same shared memory. Note that again
% this latter computation sometimes leads to long execution times within
% the RTC Toolbox. Moreover, depending on the system, the resulting total
% buffer requirement is sometimes larger than the sum of the individual
% buffer requirements. In this case, the sum of the individual buffer
% requirements provides the tighter bound to the total buffer requirement.
%
% To see this, we can use the same example as above. The individual buffer
% space requirements have been computed already:
disp(['buf1 = ', num2str(buf1), '; buf2 = ', num2str(buf2)]);
disp(['buf1 + buf2 = ', num2str(buf1+buf2)]);
%%
% Now, we can use |rtcbuf| to compute a tighter bound if all buffers share
% the same memory:
buf_sha =  rtcbuf(a_in, b1_in, ed1, b2_in, ed2);
disp(['buf_sha = ', num2str(buf_sha)]);

%% Structured Event Streams
% Structured event streams are streams which consist of multiple substreams
% that need to be decomposed into individual streams at a later stage.
% This can be used in the context of packetizing different data streams and
% transmitting them over a communication channel. The Event Count Curves
% (ECCs) are one way to describe the structure of an event
% stream that consists of several substreams. A structured event stream is 
% obtained when the events of two or more simple event streams are joined in 
% a FIFO manner, i.e. combined with an OR-activation unit. The Event Count Curves
% bound the number of events related to one specific input stream
% (sub-stream). For a fixed number of consecutive events in the combined
% stream, they give the minimum and maximum number of events related to
% this individual stream. Therefore, we can use the ECCs to decompose the
% structured event stream.
% 
% With the operator |rtcjoin| individual streams can be combined into a
% structured event stream. We obtain the
% combined stream and in addition a pair of Event Count Curves for each input stream. 
% The operator |rtcfork|
% can then be used to decompose the structured event stream
% given the individual ECCs.   
%%
% <<ECC.jpg>>
a1_in = rtcpjd(10,2);
a2_in = rtcpjd(8,1);
b_in = rtcfs(1);
ed = 1;
[a_in ecc1 ecc2] = rtcjoin(a1_in, a2_in);
[a_out b_out del buf] = rtcgpc(a_in, b_in, ed);
[a1_out a2_out] = rtcfork(a_out, ecc1, ecc2);
%%
% Both the |rtcjoin| and the |rtcstruct| operators can be applied in a 
% hierarchical manner. For instance, given two structured event streams, we 
% can join them once more by simply ignoring their structure, i.e. by treating 
% them as simple event streams. The result is a hierarchy (a tree) of ECCs.
a3_in = rtcpjd(10,1);
a4_in = rtcpjd(12,3);
a5_in = rtcpjd(16,4);
[a_in_1 ecc11 ecc12] = rtcjoin(a1_in, a2_in);
[a_in_2 ecc21 ecc22 ecc23] = rtcjoin(a3_in, a4_in, a5_in);
[a_in ecc1 ecc2] = rtcjoin(a_in_1, a_in_2);
[a_out b_out del buf] = rtcgpc(a_in, b_in, ed);
[a_out_1 a_out_2] = rtcfork(a_out, ecc1, ecc2);
[a1_out a2_out] = rtcfork(a_out_1, ecc11, ecc12);
[a3_out a4_out a5_out] = rtcfork(a_out_2, ecc21, ecc22, ecc23);
%%
% In some cases, however, it is useful to avoid such a hierarchic organization of ECCs, 
% meaning that we may want to keep the hierarchy of ECCs flat. For instance, we might 
% want to join two structured event streams and compute ECCs for
% each simple substream (with respect to the overall stream). This can be done
% by means of the function |rtcjoinstruct|. Analogously, the function |rtcforkstruct| 
% can be used to separate a structured event stream into two structured substreams, where 
% the structured substreams consist of an arbitrary combination of the simple substreams. 
[a_in_1 ecc11 ecc12] = rtcjoin(a1_in, a2_in);
[a_in_2 ecc21 ecc22 ecc23] = rtcjoin(a3_in, a4_in, a5_in);
[a_in ecc1 ecc2 ecc3 ecc4 ecc5] = rtcjoinstruct(2, 3, a_in_1, a_in_2, ecc11, ecc12, ecc21, ecc22, ecc23);
[a_out b_out del buf] = rtcgpc(a_in, b_in, ed);
[a_out_I a_out_II ecc_I_1 ecc_I_2 ecc_I_3 ecc_I_4 ecc_II_1] = rtcforkstruct(4, 1, a_in, ecc1, ecc2, ecc3, ecc4, ecc5);
[a1_out a2_out a3_out a4_out] = rtcfork(a_out_I, ecc_I_1, ecc_I_2, ecc_I_3, ecc_I_4);
a5_out = a_out_II;
%%
% The above example shows that the operators |rtcjoinstruct| and |rtcforkstruct| are more general 
% than |rtcjoin| and |rtcfork| because they permit to fork a structured stream in a different way 
% than it was generated. In other words, when forking a stream new structures of substreams can be formed.

%% Approximation of Curves
% Realistic arrival and service curves can be very complex. Even though the
% RTC Toolbox uses a very efficient curve representation, working with
% complex curves can significantly slow down all computations. Similarly,
% working with curves which consist of many segments (hundreds of
% thousands) can lead to Java 'out of memory' errors if the memory
% available for the JVM in Matlab is not sufficient to accommodate the large
% curves. One way to solve these problems is to approximate the used
% curves with curves that have fewer segments. The results computed
% with such simpler curves will be more pessimistic but still valid.
% Therefore the approximations need to be done correctly, i.e. upper curves
% should be approximated from above and lower curves from below.
%
% The RTC Toolbox provides the functions |rtcapprox| and |rtcapproxs|
% which implement correct approximations. |rtcapprox| approximates a tuple
% of curves. This is consistent with the rest of the RTC Toolbox which
% works with curve sets as explained earlier. |rtcapproxs| approximates a
% single curve.
%
% Let us take a closer look at the function |rtcapprox|. The first input
% parameter |c| is a 2x1 matrix of an upper curve and a lower curve. It is
% necessary that the matrix is of the kind: [upper; lower] since the first
% curve will be approximated from above and the second from below.
% The second input parameter |px0New| is the end of the aperiodic parts of
% the two curves (or the start of the periodic parts). If |px0New| equals
% zero, then the approximations will not
% have aperiodic parts. The third parameter |pdxNew| is the period for the 
% periodic parts of the two curves. If |pdxNew| equals zero, then the
% approximations will not have periodic parts after |px0New| but only a
% single segment. If both |px0New| and |pdxNew| are equal to zero, then the
% approximations are only single segments.
%
% Consider the upper curve:
A = rtccurve([[0,7,4];[2,15,3.5];[4,22,3];[6,28,2.5]], [[0 1 0];[2 2 1]], 8, 33, 4, 10);
%%
% and consider the lower curve:
B = rtccurve([[0,0,0];[2,0,0.5];[4,1,1];[6,3,1.5];[8,6,2]], [[0 0 0];[2 2 3]], 10, 12, 5, 11);
%%
% We can form a curve set of the two:
C = [A; B];
%%
% Both, the upper and the lower curves contain aperiodic and periodic
% parts. Let us approximate them with a completely aperiodic part until
% |px0New = 6| and afterward with a single segment.
D = rtcapprox(C,6,0);
rtcplot(C,'b', D, 'r', 60);
title('C (blue), D (red)');
%%
% The approximations are shown in red color and the original curves in
% blue.
%
% Let us now consider a better approximation with aperiodic parts finishing
% again at |px0New = 6| but now with periodic parts afterward with a period
% |pdxNew = 20|.
D = rtcapprox(C,6,20);
rtcplot(C,'b', D, 'r', 60);
title('C (blue), D (red)');
%%
% We can also consider completely periodic approximations where |px0New =
% 0| and |pdxNew = 20|.
D = rtcapprox(C,0,20);
rtcplot(C,'b', D, 'r', 60);
title('C (blue), D (red)');
%%
% The simplest approximations will be the ones containing only aperiodic
% parts with a single segment.
D = rtcapprox(C,0,0);
rtcplot(C,'b', D, 'r', 60);
title('C (blue), D (red)');
%% Extracting PJD Parameters from Curves
% Many schedulability techniques rely on standard event arrival patterns
% specified with the three parameters: P-period, J-jitter, and D-minimum
% interarrival distance between events. In some cases it is necessary to
% convert the more general event model of arrival curves into this
% more restricted PJD model. As was the case with the approximation of
% curves, computations done with the derived PJD model are more pessimistic
% but they still should be valid.
%
% The RTC Toolbox provides the function |rtcconvpjd| which returns the PJD
% parameters of a set of curves. If an optional period input parameter is
% provided, it will also compute a step size |s|, i.e. the increase in Y
% direction for the arrival of a single event. Otherwise, the assumed step
% size is 1.
%
% Consider the following upper and lower curves:
AU = rtccurve([[0,1,1];[2,5,1.5];[4,8,1.5];[6,11,0.5]], [[0 1 0];[2 2 1]], 8, 11, 4, 4);
AL = rtccurve([[0,0,0];[4,1,1.5];[10,11,0]], [[0 1 0];[2 2 1]], 17, 11, 4, 4);
%%
% Let us compute the j,d, and s parameters when |period = 3|:
[p j d s] = rtcconvpjd([AU AL], 3);
fprintf('p = %g ; j = %g ; d = %g ; s = %g \n',p ,j, d, s);
%%
% Construct a set of PJD curves from the computed parameters and scale them
% according to the computed step size for a single event:
B = rtcpjd(p,j,d);
B = rtctimes(B, s);
%%
% Plot the original and the computed PJD curves.
rtcplot([AU AL], 'r', B, 'b', 30);
title('AU and AL (red), B (blue)');


%% Improving the Accuracy by Using Curves with Additivity
% Very often a designer does not have in advance curves that bound the
% timing of event stream arrivals or the availability of resources but she
% needs to compute them from finite-length traces obtained from
% simulations. The curves constructed out of simulation traces usually may
% not possess the property of additivity, i.e. sub-additivity for upper
% curves and super-additivity for lower curves. The same result is true for
% curves constructed from several others by using operators, e.g. |rtcmin|
% or |rtcmax|. Making a pair of upper and lower curves additive does not
% violate their safety but moreover, it makes the bounds computed with them
% more accurate (tighter).
% The function |rtctighten(X,n)| will tighten a pair of upper and lower
% curves |X| by making them additive. It computes the closures of the two
% curves by using |n| fixed point iterations, i.e. |2^n| convolutions. It
% can be applied to single curves too as shown in the following example.
% 
% Let us consider the curve |f| that is not sub-additive:
f = rtccurve([[0 0 1]], [[0 0 0.25]], 2, 3, 4, 2);

%%
% This can be corrected with the following command:
t = rtctighten([f;rtccurve([[0, 0, 0]])],5);
%%
% Plot the original curve |f| and its sub-additive closure |t|:
rtcplot(f,'b',t,'r',20);
