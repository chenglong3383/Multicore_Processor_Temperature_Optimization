%% Part 1: Creating and Plotting Curves


%% "Hello World" Example
% As a first example, we create two curves |f| and |g|, compute their 
% sum |h = f + g|, and we plot all three curves in different colors.
f = rtccurve([[0 1 1];[8 9 0.25]]);
g = rtccurve([[0 1 0];[1 2 0]], 0, 5, 2);
h = rtcplus(f, g);
rtcplot(f, 'r', g, 'b', h, 'g', 20);


%% Creating Curves
% In the RTC Toolbox, the |rtccurve| function is used to generate
% arbitrary curves. The RTC Toolbox also provides a number of specialized 
% functions that can be used to easily create instances of some very
% common curve types, but these will be explained later.

%%
% A curve is defined over the complete positive x-axis |x >= 0|, 
% and consists of a list of so-called curve segments. Every curve
% segment is specified by its starting point coordinates |(x,y)| and its
% slope |s|. In Matlab, a single curve segment is represented by an array 
% of doubles |[x y s]|, and a list of curve segments is represented by a
% matrix of doubles |[[x1 y1 s1];[x2 y2 s2];[x3 y3 s3]]|. 

%%
% The simplest example of a curve consists only of a single curve segment.
f = rtccurve([[0 0 1]]);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% If a curve consists of more than one curve segment, then the range of 
% every curve segment is defined between its start point and the start
% point of the next curve segment. Note, that the first segment of a curve
% must always start at |x = 0|.
f = rtccurve([[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]]);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% If the end point of a curve segment does not coincide with the start
% point of the next curve segment, then the curve exhibits a discontinuity 
% at this point. The RTC Toolbox does not define whether a discontinuity is
% treated as left- or right-continuous. However, the various functions of 
% the RTC Toolbox will interpret a discontinuity correctly as either left- 
% or right-continuous depending on the context of the curve.
f = rtccurve([[0 0 1];[2 3 0.25]]);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% A curve may also exhibit a discontinuity at |x = 0|. Note however, that
% such a curve is interpreted by the RTC Toolbox to have the value |0| for
% |x = 0|, and a value not equal |0| for |x > 0|.
f = rtccurve([[0 1 1];[2 3 0.25]]);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% It is also possible to create curves that consist of an infinite number
% of curve segments. For this, a finite length list of curve segments is
% repeated periodically. In the context of the RTC Toolbox, this
% periodically repeated finite length list of curve segments is called the
% periodic part of a curve.

%%
% The following command creates a curve with a periodic part that is 
% repeated with a period of |p = 5|.
f = rtccurve([[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]], 5);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% The periodic part does not need to start at |y = 0|. The following
% command creates a curve with a periodic part that starts at |y = 10| and
% that is repeated with a period of |p = 5|. Note that the period p needs
% to be an integer!
f = rtccurve([[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]], 10, 5);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% Furthermore, the offset on the y-axis between two successive repetitions 
% of the periodic part can be stated explicitly. The following command
% creates a curve with a periodic part that starts at |y = 10| and
% that is repeated with a period of |p = 5| and an offset of |o = 4|.
f = rtccurve([[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]], 10, 5, 4);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% Finally, a curve that consists of an infinite number of curve segments
% can also be defined by a finite length list of curve segments that
% defines an arbitrary long start sequence of the curve, and a periodically
% repeated periodic part that defines the curve after this start sequence. 
% In the context of the RTC Toolbox, the finite length list of curve 
% segments that defines the start sequence of a curve is called the 
% aperiodic part of the curve.

%%
% The following command creates a curve with an aperiodic part |as = [[0 2
% 2]]| that consists of a single curve segment, and a periodic part |ps = 
% [[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]]| that consists of two curve segments. The periodic
% part of the curves starts at |x = 3| and |y = 10|, and has a period |p =
% 5| and an offset |o = 4|. Again note, that periods need to be integer.
f = rtccurve([[0 2 2]], [[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]], 3, 10, 5, 4);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% If the offset between two successive repetitions of the periodic part is 
% not stated explicitly, it is automatically set such that a new repetition
% of the periodic part starts at the end point of the previous repetition.
f = rtccurve([[0 2 2]], [[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]], 3, 10, 5);
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% Finally, if the y-value of the start point for the periodi part is not
% stated explicity, it is automatically set such that the first periodic 
% part starts at the end point of the aperiodic part.
f = rtccurve([[0 2 2]], [[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]], 3, 5);
rtcplot(f, 20);


%% Plotting Curves
% The |rtcplot| function can be used to visualize curves in the RTC
% Toolbox.

%% 
% Let us first create two curves |f| and |g|
f = rtccurve([[0 2 2]], [[0 0 1];[2 2 0.25]], 3, 5);
g = rtccurve([[0 0 0];[5 0 1];[10 5 2]]);

%%
% The following command plots |f| in a range |0 <= x <= 20|
rtcplot(f, 20);

%%
% The plot range can easily be specified and can be chosen arbitrarily.
% Note however, that a curve is not defined for |x < 0| and therefore the 
% plot range must be a positive number.
rtcplot(f, 200);

%%
% The plot range can also be specified detailed by providing a range on
% both the x- and the y-axis. The following command plots |f| in a range 
% |10 <= x <= 20| and |12 <= y <= 22|
rtcplot(f, [10 20 12 22]);

%%
% Various line types, plot symbols and colors may be specified to plot a
% curve by providing a character string as used in the native MATLAB |plot|
% command. For example the following command plots |f| with a red dotted
% line.
rtcplot(f, 'r:', 20);

%%
% It is also possible to plot more than one curve in the same graph.
rtcplot(f, g, 20);

%%
% By providing a seperate specification string after every curve, it is
% possible to use a different line style for every curve in a graph. For
% example the following command plots |f| with a red dotted line and |g|
% with a green dashed line.
rtcplot(f, 'r:', g, 'gREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH', 20);

%%
% Finally, the various plot parameters can be followed by parameter/value
% pairs to specify additional properties of the lines, as used in the
% native MATLAB |plot| command. The following command plots the curves |f|
% and |g| as in the previous example but with a line width of 3.
rtcplot(f, 'r:', g, 'gREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH', 20, 'LineWidth', 3);


%% Returning the y-coordinates of a Curve
% Let us first create a curve |f|.
f = rtccurve([[0 1 0];[1 2 0]], 0, 5, 2);
rtcplot(f,'b',10);

%%
% The y-coordinate of a curve |f| at any x-coordinate can be obtained by using
% the function |y = rtcvalue(f,x,dir)|. The input parameter |dir| can make
% a difference when |x| is a point of discontinuity on the curve. If |dir
% >= 0| then |y = f(x+epsilon)|, otherwise |y = f(x-epsilon)|. The
% following command will return the value of the curve |f| at
% |x=5+epsilon|.
y = rtcvalue(f,5,1);
%%
disp(['y = ', num2str(y)]);
%%
% However, the |y| value is different when taken at |5-epsilon| because
% |x=5| is a point of discontinuity for curve |f|:
y = rtcvalue(f,5,-1);
%%
disp(['y = ', num2str(y)]);

%%
% Such differences are important when one considers left-continuous and
% right-continuous curves. For a detailed explanation see: Jean-Yves Le 
% Boudec and Patrick Thiran. Network calculus: a theory of deterministic 
% queuing systems for the internet, volume 2050 of LNCS. Springer-Verlag, 2001.


%% Exporting Curves
% The |export| function can be used to export curves into a text file for
% later use. This function generates a string that, when executed in
% Matlab, is function call that will create a copy of the exported curve.
