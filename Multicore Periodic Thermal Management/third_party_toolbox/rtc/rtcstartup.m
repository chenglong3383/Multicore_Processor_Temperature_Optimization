%    STARTUP initializes the Real-Time Calculus Toolbox at startup.
%
%    If the Real-Time Calculus Toolbox is not automatically 
%    initialized at startup-time, RTC_INIT must be executed 
%    manually prior to using the Real-Time Calculus Toolbox.
%
%    If a new Real-Time Calculus Library (rtc.jar) is installed
%    at runtime, RTC_INIT must be called to load this new library.
