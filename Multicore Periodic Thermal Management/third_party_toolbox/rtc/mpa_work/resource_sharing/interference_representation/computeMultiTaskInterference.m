%RTCupperCurve = computeMultiTaskInterference(config_file, output)
%
%This function computes an RTC uppper curve, from a configuration file
%reprsenting a set of tasks executing on a processing element in a static
%periodic schedule, i.e. in a time-wheel.
%The curve represent the access pattern of the tasks on one processing unit
%to a shared resource (e.g., cache, I/O).
%
%'config_file'   ...  is the configuration file explained below.
%                     with config_file = load('\path\to\file\file.txt');
%'output'        ...  set to 1 to plot the resulting curve 
%'delta'         ...  the length of the x-axis, if output=1
%The configuration file has the following structure:
%
%
%-----------BEGIN FILE - COPY FROM HERE ------------------------------%
%%Number of tasks
%%the tasks time-slots (e.g. task 1 has 10 time units, followed by task 2
%%with 8 time units).
%%the number of super-blocks in each task (e.g. task 1 has 2 super-blocks,
%%task 2 has 1 super-block)
%%for each task 4 lines, representing the following data in that order:
%	%the min computational time needed for each super-block
%	%
%	%the max computational time needed for each super-block
%	%
%	%the min amount of cache-misses that can happen for each super block
