%C      the constant time required to execute an access request
%delta  the length of the dynamic segment
%H      distance from the end of slot k to the beginning of slot k+1
%Ltot   the amount of interfering processing elements

%EF and EP are 3 dimensional matrixes in the global scope. since for the
%functions only the layer with the appropriate slot k is required, only
%submit this layer to the function. 
%
%As an example, EP is created using zeros(4,4,4). To give only layer k to
%the function, use computeStaticSlot(k, u, i , p, EF(:,:,k), EP(:,:,k));
%Then EF and EP are common 2D matrixes with u and i as rows and columns.
